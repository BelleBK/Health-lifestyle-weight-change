## Methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Hypothesis Testing (ANOVA, Pearson correlation)
- Correlation Analysis (Pearson, Spearman, Phi, Kendall’s Tau)

## Key Findings
- Sleep quality showed a statistically significant impact on weight change
- Physical activity and calorie intake showed weaker effects
- Health outcomes appear to be influenced by multiple lifestyle factors

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Google Colab
